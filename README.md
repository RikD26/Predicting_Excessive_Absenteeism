# Employee Absenteeism Prediction

Welcome to the Employee Absenteeism Prediction GitHub repository! This project focuses on predicting excess absenteeism in employees using Python, with the help of popular libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, NumPy, and Pandas. This project is part of the Udemy course "The Complete Data Science Bootcamp" by 365 Careers, and it was completed as a solo, guided project.

## Project Overview

Excessive absenteeism can have a significant impact on an organization's productivity and efficiency. This project aims to predict instances of excess absenteeism in employees by leveraging machine learning and data analysis techniques.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into several key components:

### 1. Datasets

- **Before Preprocessing**: This folder contains the raw data files before any data cleaning or preprocessing has been applied.
- **After Preprocessing**: Here, you can find the cleaned and processed dataset ready for analysis.
- **Predictions**: After making predictions, the results are stored in this folder as CSV files.

### 2. Jupyter Files

This folder is divided into two main subfolders:

- **Module**: In this section, we've performed data preprocessing and made the data suitable for analysis. The cleaned data is identical to the data found in the "after preprocessing" folder in the Datasets section.
- **Predicting**: Here, we use the preprocessed data from the "Module" section to make predictions using machine learning models. The results of these predictions are stored as CSV files in the "Predictions" folder in the Datasets section.

## Getting Started

To explore and utilize this project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Access the Jupyter Notebook files in the "Jupyter Files" folder to understand the project workflow and analysis.

3. Review the data in the "Datasets" folder to understand the dataset before and after preprocessing, as well as the prediction results.

4. Experiment with the provided code to explore and predict employee absenteeism.
